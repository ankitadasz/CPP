reference is nothing but an another name given to the variable 
example: int x=10;
         &y=x;
         here y is reference
         &y=a its not possible
         here x only take integer memory otherwise reference has no memory
         ex=my brother buys a car so its also belongs to me it doesnot contain any extra memory
          int a;
         a=x; its called r value which stores the variable
         x=25 its called l value which stores the adress of data

         inshort:
         Reference•Reference is a Alias of variable•It must be initialised when declared•It doesn’t take any memory•It cannot be modified to refer other variable•Syntax for reference declaration is •Int &y=x;
         you cant just declare a reference without initializing it
