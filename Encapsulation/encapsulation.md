ENCAPSULATION-Wrapping up Data member and Function into a single entity
Fully Encapsulated Class= when all data members are marked private
Advantages:-
encapsulation mean information hiding like if i mark my data member rivate then i can only access it inside the class where i have created it but cant access it in another class
if we want we can make our class make readonly
code reusability
helps in unit testing
