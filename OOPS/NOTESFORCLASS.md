Pointer to an Object
A pointer of type class can be created.

A pointer can point to an existing object.

A new object can be created in the heap using a pointer.

The arrow operator (->) is used for accessing members of an object using a pointer.

Data Hiding
Data members of a class are usually declared as Private or Protected.

They can be accessed only inside the class and child classes.

Data hiding protects data from mishandling.

Constructors
A constructor is a member function of a class.

It has the same name as the class.

It does not have a return type.

It should be public (though it can be private in some cases).

It is called when an object is created.

It is used for initializing an object.

It can be overloaded.

If it is not defined, the class will have a default constructor.

A constructor can take default arguments.

Types of Constructors
Non-argument constructor

Parameterized constructor

Copy constructor

Constructors – called when an object is created.

Accessors – used for knowing the value of data members.

Mutators – used for changing the value of data members.

Facilitators – actual functions of the class.
