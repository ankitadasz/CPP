In java you cant create object in stack but in C++ you can create object in java as well as c++

method to create object:-
in stack
Rectangle r;
in heap
Rectangle *p=new Rectangle();

dot operator is used to access the member of the object using variable name whereas the -> operator is used to access the member of the object using pointer on an object

pointer takes 2 byte of memory but it depends upon the compiler so it can also take 4 byte
