## Difference Between Structure in C and Structure in C++

- A structure exists in both C and C++.
- In C, you can **only access data members**; functions cannot be part of a structure.
- In C++, you can access **both data members and member functions** within a structure.
- In C++, a structure is more like a class, so instead of writing a class, you can use a structure with similar functionality.

## Difference Between a Structure and a Class

- In a **structure**, everything is **public by default**.
- In a **class**, everything is **private by default**.
- If you want members to be public in a class, you need to explicitly specify `public:`, otherwise they remain private.
